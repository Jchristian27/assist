    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Jonathan, and I'm a web developer based out of Eureka, CA. 
      I've been a freelance front-end web developer for the past few years, 
      building websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, with the rise 
      of AI models like GPT-4 and a surge in cheap overseas competition, finding 
      steady work has become a massive challenge for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      To navigate this new reality, I decided last July to transition to 
      back-end web development. It's much more complex work than front-end 
      development, but I figured it will buy me some time before AI models take 
      over completely. While I've been making great progress on learning 
      back-end programming, I do not yet possess the skills necessary to land a 
      job as a junior back-end developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around Thanksgiving, I came up with an idea for a web app that I believe 
      will find excellent product-market fit while still being simple enough to 
      build and run as a one person business. Better yet, by owning a business 
      rather than being an employee, I won't need to fret about AI rendering my 
      newly acquired back-end development skills obsolete in the next few years.
      Instead, I plan to leverage future AI to grow my web app business to 
      provide for my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      As exciting as this idea is, bills still need to be paid. Building this 
      web app will be a 3 month sprint on paper, but in reality it might take 
      me closer to 6 to 9 months to get it done given my self-taught learning 
      curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support myself in the meantime, I've decided to embrace a different 
      kind of freelance work, offering digital assistance to real estate agents 
      in California. Why this path? Working as a freelance assistant will allow 
      me to work from home, maximizing the amount of time I can work on my web 
      app in between tasks for clients. It's a strategic move to prioritize my 
      app's development while meeting immediate financial needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, I believe my skill set aligns well with the demands of real 
      estate agents. As a real estate agent, you must navigate a myriad of 
      responsibilities—managing people, interpreting data, conducting market 
      research—a one-person business, essentially. Drawing from my experience 
      juggling freelance development and analytical work, I can contribute by 
      doing the kinds of tasks that you don't love doing, but must do to keep 
      your business running.
