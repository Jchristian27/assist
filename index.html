    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Jonathan, and I'm a web developer based out of Eureka, CA. 
      I've been a freelance front-end web developer for the past few years, 
      building websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, with the rise 
      of AI models like GPT-4 and a surge in cheap overseas competition, finding 
      steady work has become a massive challenge for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last July I decided to transition to back-end web development in search 
      of better work opportunities. Back-end development is much more complex 
      than front-end development, so my thinking was that this career shift 
      should buy me a few years before AI models catch up and replace humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months into my journey of learning back-end development, my career 
      goals changed. I came up with an idea for a web app that serves a niche 
      that's small enough to avoid competition from larger companies, while 
      still being simple enough to build and run as a one-person business. 
      Better yet, by owning a business rather than being an employee or 
      freelancer, I won't need to fret about AI rendering my newly acquired 
      back-end development skills obsolete in the next few years. Instead, I 
      can leverage the AI that will be available in the near future to scale 
      my web app business and provide my family and I with a more stable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      As exciting as pursuing this new goal has been, I still have bills to 
      pay while working on making it happen. I've successfully built a 
      prototype of my idea, so, at this point, I simply need to refine it and 
      build out more robust infrastructure to offer it to paying users. My 
      current estimate for how long this will take is around 3 months. However, 
      estimates tend to be overly optimistic, so it could take me closer to 6 
      months to get it done given my self-taught learning curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support myself in the meantime, I've decided to embrace a different 
      kind of freelance work, offering virtual assistant services to real 
      estate agents. I chose to pursue this path because working as a virtual 
      assistant allows me to work from home, maximizing the time I can dedicate 
      to my web app when I'm not completing tasks for clients. It's a strategic 
      move to prioritize my app's development while still meeting my immediate 
      financial needs by leveraging my skills to reduce the workload of real 
      estate agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to pursue work with real estate agents specifically because I 
      believe my skill set aligns well with the demands you face. As a real 
      estate agent, you have to regularly navigate a myriad of responsibilities
      â€”managing people, interpreting data, conducting market research, and 
      more. Leveraging my experience with freelance development and analytical 
      work, I aim to reduce your workload by handling the more mundane aspects 
      of your job. By working with me, you'll have more time for high-leverage 
      activities, ultimately boosting your ability to close more deals.
